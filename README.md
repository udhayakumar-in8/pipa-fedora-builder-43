- Common Packages:
	- ```fish``` for a better command line experience, default for ```user```
	- ```tuned``` & ```tuned-ppd``` for better performance and power profiles in Gnome and KDE
	- ```widevine-installer``` from Asahi Linux

### Kernel Status:
| Sleep | Speakers | Mic | WLAN | Bluetooth | (Fast) Charging | Battery Status | Hall | Display | Brightness | Touch | GPU | USB (Host/Client) | DP alt mode | UFS | Back Camera | Front Camera | Sensors | Xiaomi Keyboard | Pen | Hall Sensor

### User Notes:
- Kernel updates are handled by dnf. The updated boot image will be flashed to the active slot
  
### Default Credentials:

- **Admin (sudo) User**
  - Username: `user`
  - Password: `147147`

- **Root**
  - Username: `root`
  - Password: `fedora`

Change these default credentials after installation.

### Issues (all flavors):
- Front camera doesnt work, back camera might
- Sensors may break after suspend, so they are disabled by default. To enable them install ```pipa-sensors``` and enable the ```iio-sensor-proxy``` & ```hexagonrpcd-sdsp``` services
- To automatically restart the services and fix the sensors, install ```pipa-sensor-restart```. It takes ~10-15s after waking for the sensors to come back online (might not always work)

### Tips and Tricks:
- Run ```widevine-installer``` to install the Widevinde CDM for Firefox and Chromium based browsers, works for system packages only. **(The widevine CDM module is not altered in any way, nor is it preinstalled or distributed by me)**
- Visit [Pipa Linux Wiki](https://rr1111.github.io/pipa-linux-wiki) for more & general Info
- KDE Flavors: 
	- Apply the screen rotation to plasmalogin in Settings -> Login Screen -> Apply Plasma Settings...
- Gnome Flavor:
	- Configure the preinstalled Gnome Rotation Extension as manual Rotation toggle
	- Install the [GJS OSK extension](https://github.com/Vishram1123/gjs-osk) to make the Gnome OSK usable (if your enter key gets stuck, remove it)
	- Install the [TouchUP extension](https://github.com/mityax/gnome-extension-touchup) to make the Gnome Shell more usable on a Touchscreen
